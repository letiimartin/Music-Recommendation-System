# Music Recommendation System  - MIT Professional Education Capstone Project

## Overview

This project is the Capstone work for the 'Applied Data Science' program offered by MIT Professional Education. It aims to recommend the top 10 songs to users and represents the culmination of applying data science techniques and recommendation systems.

## Project Deliverables

The project comprises three main deliverables that reflect the progression of analysis and the robustness of the recommendations:

- **Milestone Submission (`Music_Recommendation_System_Full_Code.ipynb`):** Initial data analysis and problem exploration with a set of preliminary results. Various machine learning methods were explored, presenting the initial findings and patterns relevant to the problem.
- **Final Submission (`Music_Recommendation_System_Full_Code_2.ipynb`):** Detailed construction of the final model and optimization, with a thorough assessment of techniques and relative performance.
- **Live Presentation (`Music-Recommendation-System.pdf`):** Executive summary of the proposed solution presented in the final stage of the project.

## Data

Two datasets are fundamental to this analysis:

- `song_data.csv`: Contains song identification information, title, album, artist, and year of release.
- `count_data.csv`: Records the number of times each song was played by users, along with unique user and song identifiers.
The data files for this project are available for download via the following Google Drive links:

## Problem Statement

The project's objective is to tackle the challenge of effectively recommending music in a fast-paced business environment where capturing user attention and enhancing customer experience is paramount.

## Capstone Journey

- **Problem Definition:** Focuses on the problem's importance, the objective, key questions, and the problem formulation.
- **Data Exploration:** Description of data, observations, key patterns, and pre-processing data treatments.
- **Modeling:** Constructs and evaluates various models to address the research question.
- **Solution Proposal:** Recommends a final solution design based on previous analyses and findings.

This work was conducted on Google Colab to leverage computational capabilities and the platform's ease of use.
